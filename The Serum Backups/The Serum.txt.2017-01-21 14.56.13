Extra lore:
The blocks keep the dots(the modded people) around as they make a specialized drug called Big-O, a small translucent indigo color crystal made only by a few of the modded woman that had intercourse on the mind when they got affected with the parasite. The crystal is produced in the vagina and can be harvested once every day. This drug is highly addictive but non-lethal no matter what the dose; also there are no draw backs or negative effects on the body that has been observed.

A Serum made from a certain wasp that inhibit the abilities of gifted people that are hunted by normal people because they.... still have to  figure it out why regular people would want to hunt them down, Bone manipulation (sometimes osteokinesis) is the ability to manipulate the bones  in one's own body. For example, one might be able to grow bones from various places on the body to use as weapons, or alter the density in one's  bones to make them extremely durable and strong.

DNA spliced wasp called the "black potters" a mix between the potter wasp, black wasp and paper wasps are used for the serum

The blocks name is derived by the way the cities are constructed, a five story building sticking out of the ground with no windows, the roof is constructed out of high density graphene polymer that can be seen through from the inside but from outside it is black in colour(they also act as the main solar pannels for the block), the block then extends underground for another 50 floors.

Chapter 1: Welcome Home

�ffffuuuuccccckkkk, is it sup�.. ssshhhiiittt!, is it supposed to burn like this?!�, he gasped as the burning sensation crept through his veins. �You get used to it after the third or fourth dose, we don�t notice it any more, feels more like a rush than anything else to tell you the truth and you don�t have to worry the next shot is only four days from now� he said as the needle withdrew from the young Asian man�s arm leaving a small bead of blood behind.
�You�re free to stay here but you�re going to have to start earning a living in the next week, I dislike free loaders�, a half smile came over the stone faced man, it seemed very out of place to Ian but for now he couldn�t care less as the burning started up again now spreading from his upper legs down to his feet. �Think you need to sit down you look real pale kid, very few pass out from the treatment but you seem close to� shit he passed out.�

Ians body felt heavy as though he had been drugged or just hit in the face with a baseball bat, as he slowly drifted back to conciseness the feeling of his heavy body was replaced instead by a weight on his body. With a start Ian realized that the weight was on top of him and it was soft and warm, his eyes shot open half blinded by the light coming in from the open window.
He could make out the shape of another person that was on top of him as panic set in and he struggled furiously to break free from his captives grip. They both fell hitting the hardwood floor with a thud, he sprang up and had to catch himself on the edge of the bed before he fell over from light headedness. He lifted his free arm to his face readying himself for a fight, trying to ready himself for a fight he could feel a part of himself emerging from deep inside his mind like other him waking trying to wake up, struggling to come forward to help him.

"Hold on there stud" a warm voice called out to him from the other side of the bed, "You need to calm down otherwise your going to cancel out the last injection there handsome". as his eyes adjusted to the light he could see Sarah standing there now, arms crossed and a wicked smile running from one cheek to the other. "How did I get here" his raspy voice filled the empty room. "You were passed out for the last couple days stud, that injection really did a number on you, only heard of a few people reacting that strongly to the injection" she said walking over to the cupboard still wearing that wicked smile of hers. "You might want to get dressed before leaving", Ian looking down only now realising he was almost striped completely bare of any clothing except for his underwear. Blushing he quickly covered his crotch area looking up at Sarah with dismay, she was now moving to the door on the on the other side of the door "Once your dressed find Stack he will help you find your new place and some work".

Once outside Ian was surprised by the bustling of people and how many of them there were, "Hey you Ian?" he turned to the origin of the question and saw a small framed man not allot bigger than him standing there looking at him, his dark eyes waiting for an answer, "Ya that's me sorry" he started towards the man "I'm Ian, are you Stack", "Yip" even as the reply came Ian stopped in his tracks noticing that it wasn't the Iris that was dark in Stacks eyes but most of the eye itself was dark brown. "What you stuck to the ground?" Stack asked in confusion of the situation, "Your eyes, are you ok?", Stack hiding a glint of irritation "Let's walk and talk, we have allot to do today" Stack turned and started walking at a fast pace. From behind Stack heard Ians footsteps running closer to him, "I'm sorry for reacting that way...", "Its fine you're going to see allot of mods going through the camp, I would advise you get use to it as quickly as possible otherwise you might offend others". Ian followed him quietly to embarrassed to try make any further conversation.

Stack stopping in front of what looked like a small shack made of sink plates and the opening digging into the ground like a mid-evil mine, a cool draft was coming from the entrance of the make shift tunnel, �So the pit is your home for the next few weeks, curfew is 6 pm sharp�, tilting his head toward Ian waiting for a response. �Does everyone live underground?� Ian feeling uncertainty creeping into the corners of his mind. �Nope just the new guys�, Stack turning from the entrance and started walking off, �Com'n need to show you where you'll be helping out�. Ian turning to follow Stack again �Why do only the new comer sleep there?� , �For the same reason Sarah had to talk you down this morning, you don�t have any control over your mods yet and with the shit you have been through these couple days you need the isolation to sort through it all�.

"Aright this is the hive, this'll be your new job, go in and get your assignment" Stack said while already starting to walk away from Ian again. Looking
