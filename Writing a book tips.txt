Writing book tips

I am writing to create great works that others will enjoy reading allot (the way I like the expanse series).
I'm writing to make it my day job, to be at home and write from there.

Remember writing a book is 80% mental and 20% figuring out how to do it, I know how to write now I just need to do it

1. Create a chapter name
2. Outline the main ideas that will happen in the chapter.
3. Finish a chapter before moving on to the next one.
